    worker's largest three expected incomes:

        68 000
        72 000

let rate = 1.4%

let **years_of_service_at_retirement = 65 - current_age + current_years_ of_service**

    **years_of_service_at_retirement = 35**

let **average_of_best_3_annual_incomes = (sum of largest three expected incomes)/3**
    average_of_best_3_annual_incomes = ($65,000 + $68,000 + $72,000)/3
    average_of_best_3_annual_incomes = $205,000/3

pension_income = average_of_best_3_annual_incomes * rate * years_of_service_at_retirement
    pension_income = ($205,000/3) * 0.014 * 35
